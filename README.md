# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
The application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. 

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
A branch of computer science that deals with designing developing and tsting of software applications.Traditional programming focuses more on coding for a specific task unlike software engineerin that deals with the entire software development

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Requirement gathring
Design
Implementation
Testing
Deployment
Maintainance

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Requirement gathring:collection of documents and tools necessary according to the system requirement
Design:Blueprint representation of the system
Implementation:The actual code for the system
Testing:Check to ensure system meets users requirements
Deployment:Launchin of the system after completion
Maintainance:provide support guidance and updates for the system regularly


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Agile:an iterative and increamental approahto project management
Waterfall:a software development process that illustrates the SDLC as a waterfall

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
In both the prvious phase is completed before moving to the next
Agile allows for changes while waterfall doesnt allow for change

Agile is more suitable for projects with a large uncertainity and changing requirements whil waterfall is best for projects with well defined scopes
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
requirement engineering is the process of defining documenting and maintaining requirements in the engineering design process
requirement engineering ensures that software meets the customers needs 

Software Design Principles:
single responsibility principle each module should have one reason to change
open close principle software entities should be open for extensionsbut not for modification

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? 
a design principle in software engineering that deals with breaking a complex system into smaller independent modules,modular systems can easily be extended without affecting the exicting codebase

Testing in Software Engineering:
evauation of a software product to determines meets the required conditions or not.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing).
 Importance of Testing: Testing is a critical aspect of QA and involves various types of testing, including:
Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

 Why is testing crucial in software development?
evauation of a software product to determines meets the required conditions or not and to check for errors and vulnarabilities

.
Version Control Systems:


What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.  

 software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time
automates the process of version control
cloud-based version control systems ie github    it has a distributed version control,it is secure and scalable


Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
project planning:defining project role goal and scope
resource allocation:assigning task and responsibility
communication among team leadrs and workers

unrealistic deadlines 
undefined scope
inadequate resources

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
The process of modifying and updating the system after delivery
adaptive maintainance -adoptig the software to th users requirements
perfective maintainance- improving software to make it more efficient
preventative maintainance- taking measures to prevent errors and viruses
corrective management - involves fixing errors in the software
this helps to reduc downtime and ensure software continues to meet usre requirements
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
data privacy and security they should ensure that the data they collect is private
ethical ecision making considering every potential concequence of their code

Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
